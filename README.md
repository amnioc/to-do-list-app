# To Do List - A One Page React App

Allows the user to add to their personal to-do list, removing with a check-box = "done!" Need to leave and come back? No problem, the app will remember your tasks!

# **Tech Stack**
Created using React Frameworks, HTML5, CSS.

## How To View App

### Reflections 09/04/2024

I returned to this app after 11 months, to review code and update CSS for a more responsive, user friendly experience.
Changes made include:

- consistent semantic HTML
- updating CSS to reflect different screen sizes
