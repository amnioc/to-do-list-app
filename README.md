# Tiny React Apps

This Repo contains the following Tiny React Apps:

1. ## Dice Roller

   Taking inspiration from Dungeons & Dragons games, this dice roller can be modified based on a Dungeon Master's instruction!

2. ## To Do List
   An app that allows the user to add to their to-do list, removing with a check-box = "done!"

These apps utilise React Frameworks.

Tiny applications provide achievable goals, small projects that I am able to start and finish in a matter of days and can potentially improve or scale later (watch this space!)

## Credits

The idea for React tiny apps comes from the following article by Andrew Farmer:

Some examples of the tiny-apps that they built can be found here:
